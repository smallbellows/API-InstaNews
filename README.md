## Reflections on this assignment

Building this site was a great way to get very comfortable with navigating through a complex API and targeting specific values to insert into the DOM. Once I fully understood the structure of the NYT API, I felt more confident implementing the functionality of the site.

Working on this project was my first use of a CSS preprocessor and of running Gulp tasks. Using the two together, I was able to establish a comfortable workflow for this project and really appreciate the importance of using these tools.

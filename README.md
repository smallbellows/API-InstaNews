## Reflections on this assignment

Building this site was a great way to get very comfortable with navigating through a complex API and targeting specific values to insert into the DOM. Once I fully understood the structure of the NYT API, I felt more confident implementing the functionality of the site.

Working on this project was my first use of a CSS preprocessor and of running Gulp tasks. Using the two together, I was able to establish a comfortable workflow for this project and really appreciate the importance of using these tools.

I used AirBnB presets for my .jscsrc and .jshintrc files, to ensure that my code follows establised best-practices. I was able to run these through my gulp workflow so that I would get warnings when I had errors rather than having it just hard exit out of gulp. Getting that figured out on my own was both incredibly helpful to my workflow and also showed me that I actually understood gulp and how to use the documentation to solve problems.
